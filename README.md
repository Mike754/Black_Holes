This is for my second year Integrated Science enrichment project, where we explore black holes through general relativity and tehrmodynamics. I am focusing on finding 
particle trajectories around and in black holes. My code as it stands enlists the Runge-Kutta method to solve the first order differential equations for radius and azimuthal angle
as parametric equations. Going forward, I would like to explore metrics other than the Schwartzchild metric to model tets object behaviour within a black hole.
